This model is a remix of Pezmc's relephant plant pot.

I liked the idea of the raised platform letting the plants stay above water at the bottom, but then I noticed that the
nose was plugged in that remix which could hurt plants in the long run.  
To top stagnant water from sitting under the plants and potentially getting their roots in it causing rot, I hollowed
out the bottom a bit, made the nose hole larger, and then slanted the bottom underneath the platform to drain excess
water out of the elephant's nose.

The platform from the original model works so I would download the platform there and then the elephant pot from this
one, but I also included it in this print for ease of access. Credit goes to @Pezmc for the platform!
